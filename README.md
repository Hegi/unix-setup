# Unix System Initializer (Debian)

This repository contains scripts that can initialize a developer environment. The installed tools are console (terminal)
heavy, because I am primarily working on a WSL Distro, but I included a handful apps for those who are either dual
booting their system or using a Debian flavor directly.

The script will be extensively tested with both Ubuntu and Debian distros once a week with GitHub Actions. This shall
help flag build breaking changes in time. Granted if a diviation occures between the Debian/Ubuntu docker image and the
installable OS / WSL those will need to be fixed manually. While I'll try and test the installer every once in a while
I am making no promisses.

## Installation

```bash
dotfiles_repo="https://github.com/Hegi/dotfiles-public.git"
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/Hegi/unix-setup.git
cd unix-setup
sudo ./install.sh "${dotfiles_repo}"
cd ..
```
