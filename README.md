# Unix System Initializer (Debian)

This repository contains scripts that can initialize a developer environment. The installed tools are console (terminal)
heavy, because I am primarily working on a WSL Distro, but I included a handful apps for those who are either dual
booting their system or using a Debian flavor directly.

The script will be extensively tested with both Ubuntu and Debian distros once a week with GitHub Actions. This shall
help flag build breaking changes in time. Granted if a diviation occures between the Debian/Ubuntu docker image and the
installable OS / WSL those will need to be fixed manually. While I'll try and test the installer every once in a while
I am making no promisses.

## What's not covered?

While this setup _should_ be working in native linux, it's not tested. The script is also not modular, it has everything
I use in a way that testing and script execution is optimized. So no modularity. If you want to remove things, you'll
have to go through the whole install_lib file. Same goes if you want to add something.

This library also not covers how to install nerdfonts in your favourite terminal, because YMMW. However w/o installing
at least one - and using it - some of the characters in the console won't show up; making the experience subpar. If you
don't want to use a nerdfont, that's understandable, however you'll have to tweak quite a lot of configuration for the
apps used here.

## Fresh installation in WSL

If you want to do a fresh installation on WSL, but you already have Debian distro, here is how you can throw it away:

```powershell
wsl --unregister Debian
wsl --install -d Debian --web-download
```

After unregister, docker will complain that it's Debian integration is failing. After re-installing the distro, you can
simply click on the docker restart button and all should be well.

If your you just installed the Debian distro in WSL for the first time, make sure that you enable the docker WSL
integration for the distro, before you move on

## Installation

```bash
dotfiles_repo="https://github.com/Hegi/dotfiles-public.git"
[[ ! $(type git) ]] && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/Hegi/unix-setup.git
cd unix-setup
sudo ./install.sh "${dotfiles_repo}"
cd ..
```

While the above installation, and dotfile management works, it has one significant drawback: if any of your dotfiles
contain a secret, it gets into version control. And while it's obvious how unsecure is to make such a repo public,
keeping it private is only marginally better, if you are hosting the repo with a cloud provider such as GitHub or GitLab.
Imagine that the provider gets a data-breach and your private dotfiles repo is a victim of said breach. Your secrets are
just as compromised.

To avoid this scenario, I'd recommend the following measures being taken:

1. **DO NOT** host such a repo with a cloud provider.
2. Encrypt the repository if you store it remotely.

### Self-hosting

To address the first callout, you can do one of two things: If you have more than one device that needs the dotfiles,
then you can clone and pull between said devices with git. Just use `git remote add name url` to specify the machines,
then you can do `git pull basement-server`, `git pull laptop`, `git pull nas` etc. Granted, you won't be able to push
but you'll have redundancy in place, so if one of the devices needs a re-install, you can get the dotfiles config from
another.

Or if you have a server running, and have ssh access to said server, then you can setup a bare repo on the server
somewhere and pull/push that way. `git init --bare repo.git` is the command you are looking for in this case.

### Encryption

The problem with the self-hosted server is the same as with the cloud provider hosted one. Yes, if your own hardware
gets compromised you have bigger problems. Never the less if you want to add in an extra layer of security, you can
use `git-remote-gcrypt` to wrap the remote operations and encrypt the data that's being written into the repository.
The biggest downside of this approach - beyond the ones documented at [git-remote-gcrypt-](https://github.com/spwhitton/git-remote-gcrypt) -
is that you'll need a unix machine to decrypt the content. Given that we are planning to use this to manage linux configuration
this shouldn't be a show-stopper; especially with the WSL integrations, I wanted to be explicit with it, before you start
wanting to use this approch with other repos as well.

Now can you just encrypt the repo, and store it as a private one in a cloud provider? Sure! Do I recommend doing it? Nope!
And before you mention that I am about to do the exact same thing bellow, let me remind you that this entire repo is
mostly for demo purposes, and that there is absolutely nothing sensitive in the repo in question. Further more I am also
sharing the encryption key for said repo, so at this point it's only technically encrypted.

### Installation using an encrypted dotfiles repo

Make sure you have a gpg key for encryption and that you backed it up into a file. If you don't you can use the
`gpg --full-generate-key` command to create one, then the
`gpg -o dotfiles.asc --armor --export-options backup --export-secret-keys 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
command to export it into a file called `dotfiles.asc`. The `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` stands for the
id of the key, which you can fetch with the `gpg -k` command.

In case you want to test it with a pre-cooked encryption setup, here is the gpg-key for the encrypted version of the
same dotfiles-public repo:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > dotfiles.asc
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

```

Here's the modified installer script:

```bash
dotfiles_repo="gcrypt:git@github.com:Hegi/dotfiles-encrypted-public.git"
dotfiles_key_path="./dotfiles.asc"
[[ ! $(type git) ]] && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
[[ ! $(type git-remote-gcrypt) ]] && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git-remote-gcrypt
git clone https://github.com/Hegi/unix-setup.git
cd unix-setup
sudo ./install.sh "${dotfiles_repo}" "${dotfiles_key_path}"
cd ..
```

Please note that if you used a passkey for the gpg key, you'll be prompted for it each time you pull or push the
dotfiles repo. This includes the installation process.
